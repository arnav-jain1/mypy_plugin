* empty
* **SLICING**
* figure out what to do with errors



Todo soon: 
  test cases (big)
  error messages
  .dot (easy peasy)
  reshape (less easy)
  S L I C I N G (wheel c? Maybe something hacky for now)



# Notes
numpy._core.multiarray.array appears for get_dynamic_class_hook, could migrate
NVM all i have to work with is 
DEBUG: add ndarray called: CallExpr:20(
  MemberExpr:20(
    NameExpr(np [numpy])
    multiply [numpy.multiply])
  Args(
    NameExpr(a [test.a])
    NameExpr(b [test.b])))
